/*

Variables
* base - buffer address - fixed during execution
* start - the current read cursor - reset to base after a reset or when a read clears count to zero - incremented on reads
* count - effectively the current write cursor, as an offset beyond start.  Incremented on writes, decremented on reads
* top and threshold - the buffer limits - top used to calculate the size of a socket read request - threshold used to decide when a reset should occur
Algorithm
Read ->
* Check if the request can be satisfied from the buffer (req cont =< count) - if it can exit via ‘satisfy’
* Check if there is a need to reset the buffer - if so, do buffer reset before next stage
* Execute the socket read, return to the top (except if zero return in which case it is a fail)
