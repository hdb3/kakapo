This functional test validates a BGP speaker is correctly (?) receiving and forwarding routes.

The source and sink happen to be bird - the DUT simply has to have a matched configuration with the two birds.

Here is that configuration:

source: (bird configuration bird.conf/as65001.conf)

	as: 65001
        address: 127.0.1.1

DUT:
        
	as: 65002
        address: 127.0.1.2
        
source: (bird configuration bird.conf/as65003.conf)

	as: 65003
        address: 127.0.1.3

The route expected is:

	prefix: 7.7.7.0/24

For the cases in which the loopback interface is not acceptable, the configurations can simply be transformed by substitution.

NB:the DUT should ideally be configured as a passive BGP speaker
