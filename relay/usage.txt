# Usage
'relay2' is the current supported system.

The operational principle is a two way relay between ports, in practiice usually two.
This allows seprated end points to establish BGP sessions as long as their OPEN messages are mutually acceptable.

Both parameters are IP addresses.  The first is a 'listen' address to use for binding the server.  Use '0.0.0.0' to listen on more than one port.
The second is the remote address for the special peer designated as 'listener'.

Relay starts forwarding messages as soon as the listener peer connection is established. (?????)
