raw 'json' files are not valid JSON, rather, sequences of valid JSON objects.

They can be made valid JSON by conversion to lists, by adding brackets and removing extraneous trailing commas.
The sed form of this is:

$ sed -e '1 i \ [' -e '$ s/,$/\]/'

Note: two separate expressions here:
- -e '1 i \ ['
- -e '$ s/,$/\]/'

Some older 'JSON' data was written invalidly - there were missing commas between objects.
The following sed fixes this up, safely.

$ sed -i -e 's/""/","/g'
