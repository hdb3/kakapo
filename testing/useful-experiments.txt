Variation in table parameters is not so interesting unless some non-linear behaviour is seen.
So, work with 'full' tables.

Multi-peer tests are not so interesting for the same reason, except that for some BGPs it seems that this is a way to really push them over the limit.

Variations in update lengths and block sizes, ditto.  One can presume that larger NLRIs are faster to process than lots of smaller ones.

What is the range of variants available:
1) number of prefixes packed in a single update message.
2) tablesize
3) number of peers
